# Quillquest — project instructions

Browser app for co-writing a narrative step-die RPG. Design: `docs/design-plan.md`. Rules: `docs/rules-v4.md`
(these are text extractions of the original Claude docs; tables are flattened — fix formatting as you touch them).

## Standing rules
- Read both docs before any change. Where they disagree, Rules v4 governs.
- The rules engine (`packages/rules`) is the source of truth; UI and server code never re-implement a rule.
- Pure functions, no I/O; randomness comes in through an injected dice source.
- Write or update tests before code; run the full suite before finishing.
- Use rank words in anything a player sees; dice appear only in the reveal view and in tests.
- Never send GM-only data to a player route; add a server test for every new route.
- Claude prompts live in `packages/prompts` with fixed test cases.
- One milestone per session (M1 rules engine → M7), starting in plan mode.

## Commands
```
pnpm install
pnpm test        # vitest, all packages
pnpm typecheck
```

## Status
M1 started: rank ladders, dice mapping, exact odds primitives. Next: applyShifts, setCard, odds(card), resolve, push
(design plan §4.2) with the §4.4 tests written first.
